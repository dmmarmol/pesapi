# PES Database API
> Using node.js

The main goal of this project is to support a JSON Rest API with data fetched from [pesdb.net](http://pesdb.net) to allow different operations and manipulation of the data.

This project was indented to be a proof of concept involving web scrapping and many npm libraries to gather public data from a public website and then create a simple REST API to retrieve it.
